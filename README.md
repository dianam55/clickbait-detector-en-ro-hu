# clickbait-detector

Project Overview
This repository contains code and datasets for detecting clickbait headlines in three languages: English, Romanian, and Hungarian. Multiple machine learning and deep learning models are implemented and evaluated, including:
- Traditional models: SVM (with two variations: SBERT embeddings and TF-IDF), Random Forest
- Deep learning models: LSTM, Transformer-based models: BERT / DistilBERT

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is also provided for each dataset, including common bigrams, punctuation patterns, and sentiment analysis.

Datasets:
The datasets used in this project contain headlines labeled as clickbait(1) or non-clickbait(0)
